# Degrees

A Python implementation of the **Degrees of Separation** problem using **graph search algorithms**. This project explores the shortest connection path between actors using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A* Search (A-Star Algorithm)**.

## ðŸ“Œ README: How to Use  

### Features  
âœ… Finds the shortest connection path between two actors.  
âœ… Implements **BFS** for simple shortest path searches.  
âœ… Implements **A*** for optimized pathfinding using heuristic estimation.  
âœ… Works with large actor-movie datasets.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omm2005/degrees.git
   cd degrees
   ```  
2. Install dependencies (if required):  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

### Usage  
Run the script and enter the names of two actors to find their degree of separation:  
```bash
python degrees.py
```  

#### Example Output  
```
Enter source actor: Tom Hanks  
Enter target actor: Emma Watson  
Tom Hanks â†’ Saving Mr. Banks â†’ Paul Giamatti  
Paul Giamatti â†’ The Nanny Diaries â†’ Scarlett Johansson  
Scarlett Johansson â†’ The Island â†’ Ewan McGregor  
Ewan McGregor â†’ Beauty and the Beast â†’ Emma Watson  
```
**Degrees of separation: 3**
